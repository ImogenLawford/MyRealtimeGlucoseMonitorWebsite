# RealtimeGlucoseMonitorWebsite

This website is programmed JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. It pulls data from my continuous glucose monitor stream to display both the current reading and trend direction to give me more information about my health, and allow me to make quick judgements for management. I am using this web app as a base for a samsung watch app using Tizen OS, an open-source platform for android development to contribute to the AndroidAPS open-source movement, as a wearable blood glucose monitor app for samsung watches to use during exercise, which is not currently a commodified feature in smart watches.
